# AIML-Task1
Project Overview
The project illustrates the key steps of data cleaning and preparation for machine learning tasks. With Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, the project includes:

Importing and data exploration

Missing value handling using imputation

Handling categorical variables by encoding

Normalizing and feature scaling of numerical features

Visualizing and outlier removal

All the steps are done in a Google Colab notebook for reproducibility and sharing.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

How to Use
Open the given Google Colab notebook link.

Upload your data or change the file path in the notebook to your data.

Execute the notebook cells one after another to do data cleaning and preprocessing.

Customize imputation, encoding, and scaling techniques according to your dataset.

Project Structure
data_cleaning_preprocessing.ipynb — Google Colab notebook with the complete code and explanations.

README.md — This file, giving an overview and instructions.

Dataset
You may employ any CSV dataset with numerical and categorical variables. Ensure updating the file path or uploading your data to the Colab environment prior to executing the code.

Visualization
Boxplots are included in the notebook to visualize outliers in numerical variables to better comprehend data distribution and clean the dataset properly.
